# 100-days-of-coding-python
Just me a coding noob trying to learn python by following the 100 days of code challenge from replit.
I don't have a clear objective to why I am learning python, just got interested to getting my hands dirty by learning a whole new language from scratch.

Thank you stranger for reading this.
